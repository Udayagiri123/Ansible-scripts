Ansible architecture follows control & worker nodes scenario.

Control node or master node -
It is a server which installed ansible. Additionally we will contain the worker nodes info as inventory.ini file.

Worker node -
A remote system, or host, that Ansible controls.

Passwordless SSH authentication -
In order to access the worker machines from control machine, we need to first authenticate.
Unlike Chef or Puppet, Ansible doesn't use Agents.
It achieves it through SSH method , where in authorized keys of each remote machine we will add Public SSH key of control node
 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
